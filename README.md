# shortest-path-GDD1
This repository contains all code files for the Discrete Math Group Deep Dive 1. Our group delved deeper into three of the most popular shortest-path algorithms: Dijkstra's, A*, and Bellman-Ford. 

## Navigating the Repo
`dijkstras_GDD1.py`: Python script that takes in a graph by instantiating nodes and edges, defines a start and target node, runs Dijkstra's algorithm, and returns the shortest path to that specific node. Note that this is a different implementation than what is described in the final Python notebook; that one produces a shortest-path tree to all nodes from the start node. 

`discrete_GDD1.ipynb`: Python notebook that goes through each algorithm, providing varying types of visualizations and context for each algorithm.
